# SPA App

We've come to the point in our single page app where we want to have multiple views, and we want them to work well.  I've added a `description` field to the todo table, and I want you to create a todo detail view which shows the description of one item in the list.  There are many ways to implement this.  Here are a couple possibilities:

* Render the todo list, and render the detailed view of one todo to the right of the list.
* Render the todo list with that specific todo opened up, pushing the rest of the list down.
* Just render that todo with a link to go back to the list.

If you click into a specific todo from the list, then go back using the browser button, it should bring you back to the list.  If you go to a specific todo from the list and refresh the page, it should remain at the same view.
